# 🧬 Learning Mongoose with MongoDB

Welcome to my learning repository focused on **Mongoose**, a powerful ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB in Node.js!

In this repo, I’m exploring how to model, validate, and interact with MongoDB databases using Mongoose. Each video/topic represents a key concept that I’m practicing and documenting.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔧 Setup & Introduction
- **What is Mongoose?** – Quick overview of what Mongoose is and why it's used.
- **Installation & Setup** – Installing Mongoose and connecting it to a MongoDB database.

### 🧱 Core Concepts
- **Schema** – Defining the structure of documents using Mongoose schemas.
- **Models** – Creating models from schemas to interact with collections.

### 📝 CRUD Operations
- **Insert in Mongoose** – Adding a single document to the database.
- **Insert Multiple** – Inserting multiple records in bulk.
- **Find in Mongoose** – Querying documents with various conditions.
- **Update in Mongoose** – Modifying existing documents.
- **FindAndUpdate** – Finding and updating documents in one operation.
- **Delete in Mongoose** – Removing documents from the collection.

### ✅ Validations & Data Types
- **Schema Validations** – Enforcing rules on your schema fields (required, min, max, etc.).
- **SchemaType Options** – Exploring field types and custom options for each schema property.
- **Validation in Updation & Errors** – Handling validation errors and rules during updates.

## 💡 Why Mongoose?

Mongoose helps:
- Define models with strong typing
- Simplify MongoDB queries with built-in methods
- Add schema-level validation
- Maintain cleaner and scalable code
